# VAT-Spy colour themes

Visual colour themes to spruce up VAT-Spy.

## Installation

Replace the contents of `%AppData%\VAT-Spy\VATSpyConfig.xml` with the contents of the `.xml` file with your desired theme. Only the colour and font sections may be replaced if you have other non-standard settings you wish to keep.

Note that if a theme uses fonts not present on your system, it will not look correctly unless you install the font first. You can see the font names towards the bottom of the `.xml` theme file. Of course, you may choose to only copy the colour settings.

At some point I may create an installation utility that would copy only the required settings into your existing VAT-Spy configuration to streamline the process.

## Contributing

Feel free to create a pull request with your own theme and its screenshot, or send me a message and I'll be happy to include it on your behalf.
